        A few church-etiquette reminders:
        %ul
          %li
            $5 suggested donation for adults, kids are free (and please don't let money keep you from attending)

            Come anytime between 11 and 1
          %li
            Dance Church is a secular event, with no religious affiliation

            The main space is intended for dancing, meditating, and movement. Please use the hallway and kitchen space for conversations and refreshments.
          %li
            Please limit photography and use discretion when posting photos or videos, as we want everyone to feel safe and comfortable in their self-expression
          %li
            We like to keep the main space clear, open, and devoted to dancing, so please no table displays (product, promotional, religious, etc.)
          %li
            Come to dance!
