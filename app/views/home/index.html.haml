                Dance Church is a secular event, with no religious affiliation
              %li
                Bring a yoga mat if you like â€” there's room to stretch
              %li
                The main space is intended for dancing, meditating, and movement. Please use the hallway and kitchen space for conversations and refreshments.
              %li
                Please limit photography and use discretion when posting photos or videos, as we want everyone to feel safe and comfortable in their self-expression
              %li
                We like to keep the main space clear, open, and devoted to dancing, so please no table displays (product, promotional, religious, etc.)
              %li
                Come to dance!
